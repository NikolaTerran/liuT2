<vidio>
<audio>
<canvas> <-- drawing area
JS fxns an draw onto a canvas element <-- given an id
only 2 attr: height and width <-- default to w:300 & h:150
assignable via DOM manipulation (JS calls)


<div>
<canvas height="600" width="600" id="slate">
fallback/alternate display text here (for old, noncompliant browsers)
</div>
</canvas>


Paths used to draw arbitrary shapes,
including circles and curves

* A contxt can keep track of one path at a time
* Path is not drawn until stroke() is called
* A path is considered done when beginPath() is called anew

beginPath()
 	Starts or resets current path
stroke()
 	Renders all the lines in the path, doees not end 
 	the path.
fill()
 	Fills the interior of the path,
 	Will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it
arc()
 	Draws an arc.

Useful JS commands:
moveTo(X, Y)
 	Move path to position (x,y)
 	Does not result in a line or a filled in section
lineTo(X, Y)
 	Moves path to position (x,y)
 	will result in a line and a filled in section
closePath()
 	Results in a line from current position to start pos
 	Path can be continued after


you will not use 
setTimeout() 
setInterval()
 
 
window.requestAnimationFrame()
* executes on next available screen repaint
* pauses for background tabs, hidden frames, etc.
* is automatically passed a timestamp to mark call time
* returns a nonzero integer (canbe used as id)
* 60 fps (target)
* can be optimized by browser (smoother animations)
* more respurce efficient (battery-friendly)

syntax:
	requestAnimationFrame(callback) 
	
window.cancelAnimationFrame()
* stops animation
syntax: cancelAnimationFrame (id)
