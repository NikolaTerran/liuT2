Paths used to draw arbitrary shapes,
including circles and curves

* A contxt can keep track of one path at a time
* Path is not drawn until stroke() is called
* A path is considered done when beginPath() is called anew

beginPath()
 	Starts or resets current path
stroke()
 	Renders all the lines in the path, doees not end 
 	the path.
fill()
 	Fills the interior of the path,
 	Will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it
arc()
 	Draws an arc.

Useful JS commands:
moveTo(X, Y)
 	Move path to position (x,y)
 	Does not result in a line or a filled in section
lineTo(X, Y)
 	Moves path to position (x,y)
 	will result in a line and a filled in section
closePath()
 	Results in a line from current position to start pos
 	Path can be continued after
