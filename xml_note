XML (eXtensible Markup Language):
* meta-language: use it to create other languages
* degines a set of rules for encoding data
  in a format which is both
    human-readable and machine-readable.
* not a formatting language (ie HEML, GHFMD))
* allows you to define a file type or data type


* framework for creating markup-based grammars
* uses some syntactic standards of HTML
  (tags, attributes)

* emphasizes organizing and representing data
  (instead of redering/displayingit)

* an XML namespace is defined by the tags and
  attributes associated with a specific XML language

(there are Many existing XML namespaces)
  E.g., .docx, RSS, MathML, ..)

Latin: rastrum -- "rake"
CRT

raster encoding: bit-by-bit specification of an image
(even if compressed, a la PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc..,)

SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics
* vector image format
* XML -based
* an SVG img and its actions are defined 
  in XML test files

SVG;
Vector graphics are images not represented as a 2D grid
of pixels (raster) but instead as a 
list of drawing commands (eg: line, circle, rectangle, curve,

+ Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are 
  scalable to any size without resulting

<svg> element is designed to store SVG code (ie, SVG XML elements)

xmlns; Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML 
language being used.

eg,
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
	SVG CODE HERE
</svg>
