Event Propagation
1. An element intercepts an event
2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from
   the starting element to the root
3. Capture: event propagates down the path from step 2
4. Bubble: event propagates up the path from step 2

3.stopPropagation();
	cancel event propagation

this
has different meanings depending on the JS context from which it is being used:
* in a JS object, this refers to calling object
* in an event listener, this refers to currently triggered elemnt

.target
 returns element that began the event propagation chain
